# Modals of deduction: might, can’t, must

- Might (when you think something is possible true)

  _Examples:_

  Tony’s phone is switched off. He might be on the plane now, or just boarding.
  Laura might not like that skirt. It’s not really her style.

- Can’t (when you are sure something is impossible / not true )

  _Examples:_

  Nigel can’t earn much money in his job. He’s still living with his parents.
  That woman can’t be Jack’s wife. Jack’s wife has dark hair.

- Must (when you are sure something is true)

  _Examples:_

  The neighbors must be out. There aren’t any lights on in the house.
  Your sister must have a lot of money if she drives a Porsche.

# The Passive Voice

**active** sentence like **I drank two cups of coffee** has the subject first (the person or thing that does the verb), followed by the verb, and finally the object (the person or thing that the action happens to).

So, in this example, the subject is 'I', the verb is 'drank' and the object is 'two cups of coffee'.
But, we don't always need to make sentences this way. We might want to put the object first, or perhaps we don't want to say who did something. This can happen for lots of reasons (see the explanation further down the page). In this case, we can use a passive, which puts the object first:
Two cups of coffee were drunk (we can add 'by me' if we want, but it isn't necessary).

## How to make the Passive in English

> We make the passive by putting the verb 'to be' into whatever tense we need and then adding the past participle. For regular verbs, we make the past participle by adding 'ed' to the infinitive. So _play_ becomes _played_.

| Tense                  | Active                     | Passive                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| present simple         | I make a cake.             | A cake is made (by me).             |
| present continuous     | I am making a cake.        | A cake is being made (by me).       |
| past simple            | I made a cake.             | A cake was made (by me).            |
| past continuous        | I was making a cake.       | A cake was being made (by me).      |
| present perfect        | I have made a cake.        | A cake has been made (by me).       |
| pres. perf. continuous | I have been making a cake. | A cake has been being made (by me). |
| past perfect           | I had made a cake.         | A cake had been made (by me).       |
| future simple          | I will make a cake.        | A cake will be made (by me).        |
| future perfect         | I will have made a cake.   | A cake will have been made (by me). |

## Verbs with two objects

> Some verbs that have two objects can make two different active sentences, and so two different passive sentences too:

Give

- Active: He gave me the book / He gave the book to me.
  You can choose either of the two objects to be the subject of the passive sentence.
- Passive: I was given the book (by him)/ The book was given to me (by him).
  Other verbs like this are: ask, offer, teach, tell, lend, promise, sell, throw.

## The passive in subordinate clauses

> You can make the passive in a subordinate clause that has a subject and a normal conjugated verb. This is really the same as a normal passive.

- Active: I thought that Mary had kissed John.
- Passive: I thought that John had been kissed by Mary.
- Active: He knew that people had built the church in 1915.
- Passive: He knew that the church had been built in 1915.
  You can also make the passive using a passive gerund or a passive infinitive in the same place as a normal gerund or infinitive.
- The child loves being cuddled.
- She would like to be promoted.

## When should we use the Passive?

1. When we want to change the focus of the sentence:

   The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci. (We are more interested in the painting than the artist in this sentence)

2. When who or what causes the action is unknown or unimportant or obvious or 'people in general':
   - He was arrested (obvious agent, the police).
   - My bike has been stolen (unknown agent).
   - The road is being repaired (unimportant agent).
   - The form can be obtained from the post office (people in general).
3. In factual or scientific writing:
   - The chemical is placed in a test tube and the data entered into the computer.
4. In formal writing instead of using someone/ people/ they (these can be used in speaking or informal writing):
   - The brochure will be finished next month.
5. In order to put the new information at the end of the sentence to improve style:
   - Three books are used regularly in the class. The books were written by Dr. Bell. ('Dr. Bell wrote the books' sound clumsy)
6. When the subject is very long:
   - I was surprised by how well the students did in the test. (More natural than: 'how well the students did in the test surprised me')

# Past and present habits and states

1. I **used to teach** English when I was living abroad.

   He **didn't use to do** any exercise, but now he runs marathons

   I **never used to like** football, but I watch it every week now.

   We **used to be** close friends, but we don't talk to each other any more.

   That hotel **used to have** a swimming pool, but they closed it.

   **Did** they **use to live** in the city centre?

   **Didn't** you **use to have** long hair?

2. I **usually meet** my friends at weekends.

   I **don't normally go out** during the week.

   English houses **usually have** gardens.

   **Do** you **normally walk** to work?

## Grammar

1. For past habits and states, we use _used to / didn't use to + infinitive_

- used to does not exist in the present tense. **NOT** ~~I use to get up at 8.00 during the week.~~
- We use _used to_ for things that were true over a period of time in the past. _used to_ often refers to something which is not true now.

  _I used to do a lot of sport._ (= I did a lot of sport for a period of time in the past, but now I don't)

- We often use never _used to_ instead of _didn't use_ to.
- _used to / didn't use_ to can be used with action verbs (e.g. go, do) and non-action verbs (e.g. be, have)
- We can also use the past simple to describe past habits (often with an adverb of frequency).

  _We (often) went to France for our holidays when I was a child._

2. For present habits, we use a verb in the present simple, often with an adverb of frequency, e.g. _usually_ or _normally_.

- **used to or past simple ?**

  We can use used to or the past simple (often with an adverb of frequency) for repeated actions or states and the meaning is the same.

  _I used to live in Leeds as a child. I lived in Leeds as a child._

  _We used to go to the cinema on Sundays. We often went to the cinema on Saturdays._

  But we have to use the past simple if:

  - we mention exact dates or number of times.
  - the action happened only once.

    _We went to the cinema on Saturday_

- **any more and any longer**
  We often use not... _any more / any longer (= not now)_ with the present simple to contrast with _used to_.

  _I used to go to the gym, but I don't (go) any more / any longer._

- **be used to and get used to**
  Don't confuse _used to / didn't use to (do sth)_ with be used to or get used to (doing sth).

  **I am used to getting up** early every day. (= I am accustomed to id - I always do it, so it is not a problem for me)

  Lola **can't get used to living** in the UK. (= She can't get accustomed to it, it's a problem for her)

# Prepositions

## prepositions of place

> Prepositions that describe place, like _in_ and _on_, can be used with different verbs and places and the meaning doesn't change.

_Examples:_

- She sat **in** the square and watched the tourists.
- There's a box **under** your bed.
- You'll find some cash **inside** my purse.
- The cups are **on** that shelf there.
- There's a man standing **in front of** the gate.

## prepositions of movement

> Prepositions that describe movement, like _over_ and _through_, can be used with different verbs of movement and the meaning doesn't change.

- The plane flew **over** the city.
- He ran **across** the road.
- He walked **through** the door.
- Go **along** the street, **past** the chemist's.
- Don't run **down** the steps. You'll fall.

## dependent prepositions after verbs and adjectives

_Examples:_

1. We **waited for** the film to start.

   Everybody **laughed at** me.

2. I'm **worried about** my camera - the flash isn't working.

   Lily's **interested in** astrology.

3. Tony's **good at spending** other people's money.

   She **believes in taking** lots of pictures and then choosing the best.

- Some verbs are always followed by the same preposition.
- Some adjectives are always followed by the same preposition.
- If there is a verb after the preposition, we use the _-ing_ form, not the infinitive.

> **The verbs _ask_, _discuss_, _enter_, _marry_, and _tell_ have no prepositions, e.g.**
>
> I **asked Jack** a question. **NOT** ~~asked to~~
>
> We **discussed the situation**. **NOT** ~~discussed about~~
>
> The police officers **entered the building**. **NOT** ~~entered in~~
>
> She **married her personal trainer**. **NOT** ~~married with~~
>
> The photographer **told everyone** to smile. **NOT** t~~old to everyone~~

# Question formation

> 1. How long **have you** been waiting?
>
>    How many children **does your sister** have?
>
>    **Should we** buy her a present?
>
> 2. Why **didn't you** like the film>
>
>    **Isn't this** a beautiful place?
>
>    **Don't you** have to be at school today?
>
> 3. **What** are they talking **about**?
>
>    **Who** does this bag belong **to**?
>
> 4. **Who lives** in that house?
>
>    **How many people follow** you on Twitter?

1. We make questions with tenses where there is an auxiliary verb (_be_, _have_, etc.) and with modal verbs (_should_, _must_, etc.) by inverting the subject and the auxiliary / modal verb.

   With the present and past simple we add the auxiliary verb _do_ / _does_ or _did_ before the subject.

2. We often use negative questions to show surprise when we expect somebody to agree with us, or to check whether something is true.

3. If a verb is normally followed by a preposition, e.g. _talk about sth_, the preposition comes at the end of the question, not at the beginning. **NOT** ~~About what are you talking?~~

   We often just use the question word and the preposition, e.g.

   **A** _I'm thinking._

   **B**. _What about?_

4. Whe _who / what / which_, etc., is the **subject** of questions in the present or past simple, we don't use _do_ / _did_ e.g. _Who wrote this?_ **NOT** ~~Who did write this?~~
