# Modals of deduction: might, can’t, must

- Might (when you think something is possible true)

  _Examples:_

  Tony’s phone is switched off. He might be on the plane now, or just boarding.
  Laura might not like that skirt. It’s not really her style.

- Can’t (when you are sure something is impossible / not true )

  _Examples:_

  Nigel can’t earn much money in his job. He’s still living with his parents.
  That woman can’t be Jack’s wife. Jack’s wife has dark hair.

- Must (when you are sure something is true)

  _Examples:_

  The neighbors must be out. There aren’t any lights on in the house.
  Your sister must have a lot of money if she drives a Porsche.

# Past and present habits and states

1. I **used to teach** English when I was living abroad.

   He **didn't use to do** any exercise, but now he runs marathons

   I **never used to like** football, but I watch it every week now.

   We **used to be** close friends, but we don't talk to each other any more.

   That hotel **used to have** a swimming pool, but they closed it.

   **Did** they **use to live** in the city centre?

   **Didn't** you **use to have** long hair?

2. I **usually meet** my friends at weekends.

   I **don't normally go out** during the week.

   English houses **usually have** gardens.

   **Do** you **normally walk** to work?

## Grammar

1. For past habits and states, we use _used to / didn't use to + infinitive_

- used to does not exist in the present tense. **NOT** ~~I use to get up at 8.00 during the week.~~
- We use _used to_ for things that were true over a period of time in the past. _used to_ often refers to something which is not true now.

  _I used to do a lot of sport._ (= I did a lot of sport for a period of time in the past, but now I don't)

- We often use never _used to_ instead of _didn't use_ to.
- _used to / didn't use_ to can be used with action verbs (e.g. go, do) and non-action verbs (e.g. be, have)
- We can also use the past simple to describe past habits (often with an adverb of frequency).

  _We (often) went to France for our holidays when I was a child._

2. For present habits, we use a verb in the present simple, often with an adverb of frequency, e.g. _usually_ or _normally_.

- **used to or past simple ?**

  We can use used to or the past simple (often with an adverb of frequency) for repeated actions or states and the meaning is the same.

  _I used to live in Leeds as a child. I lived in Leeds as a child._

  _We used to go to the cinema on Sundays. We often went to the cinema on Saturdays._

  But we have to use the past simple if:

  - we mention exact dates or number of times.
  - the action happened only once.

    _We went to the cinema on Saturday_

- **any more and any longer**
  We often use not... _any more / any longer (= not now)_ with the present simple to contrast with _used to_.

  _I used to go to the gym, but I don't (go) any more / any longer._

- **be used to and get used to**
  Don't confuse _used to / didn't use to (do sth)_ with be used to or get used to (doing sth).

  **I am used to getting up** early every day. (= I am accustomed to id - I always do it, so it is not a problem for me)

  Lola **can't get used to living** in the UK. (= She can't get accustomed to it, it's a problem for her)

## prepositions of collocations

[Watch video](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/preposition-collocations-1.html)

## prepositions of time

[Watch video](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/prepositions-of-time.html)

## prepositions of place

> Prepositions that describe place, like _in_ and _on_, can be used with different verbs and places and the meaning doesn't change.

_Examples:_

- She sat **in** the square and watched the tourists.
- There's a box **under** your bed.
- You'll find some cash **inside** my purse.
- The cups are **on** that shelf there.
- There's a man standing **in front of** the gate.

## prepositions of movement

> Prepositions that describe movement, like _over_ and _through_, can be used with different verbs of movement and the meaning doesn't change.

- The plane flew **over** the city.
- He ran **across** the road.
- He walked **through** the door.
- Go **along** the street, **past** the chemist's.
- Don't run **down** the steps. You'll fall.

## dependent prepositions after verbs and adjectives

_Examples:_

1. We **waited for** the film to start.

   Everybody **laughed at** me.

2. I'm **worried about** my camera - the flash isn't working.

   Lily's **interested in** astrology.

3. Tony's **good at spending** other people's money.

   She **believes in taking** lots of pictures and then choosing the best.

- Some verbs are always followed by the same preposition.
- Some adjectives are always followed by the same preposition.
- If there is a verb after the preposition, we use the _-ing_ form, not the infinitive.

> **The verbs _ask_, _discuss_, _enter_, _marry_, and _tell_ have no prepositions, e.g.**
>
> I **asked Jack** a question. **NOT** ~~asked to~~
>
> We **discussed the situation**. **NOT** ~~discussed about~~
>
> The police officers **entered the building**. **NOT** ~~entered in~~
>
> She **married her personal trainer**. **NOT** ~~married with~~
>
> The photographer **told everyone** to smile. **NOT** t~~old to everyone~~

# Question formation

> 1. How long **have you** been waiting?
>
>    How many children **does your sister** have?
>
>    **Should we** buy her a present?
>
> 2. Why **didn't you** like the film>
>
>    **Isn't this** a beautiful place?
>
>    **Don't you** have to be at school today?
>
> 3. **What** are they talking **about**?
>
>    **Who** does this bag belong **to**?
>
> 4. **Who lives** in that house?
>
>    **How many people follow** you on Twitter?

1. We make questions with tenses where there is an auxiliary verb (_be_, _have_, etc.) and with modal verbs (_should_, _must_, etc.) by inverting the subject and the auxiliary / modal verb.

   With the present and past simple we add the auxiliary verb _do_ / _does_ or _did_ before the subject.

2. We often use negative questions to show surprise when we expect somebody to agree with us, or to check whether something is true.

3. If a verb is normally followed by a preposition, e.g. _talk about sth_, the preposition comes at the end of the question, not at the beginning. **NOT** ~~About what are you talking?~~

   We often just use the question word and the preposition, e.g.

   **A** _I'm thinking._

   **B**. _What about?_

4. Whe _who / what / which_, etc., is the **subject** of questions in the present or past simple, we don't use _do_ / _did_ e.g. _Who wrote this?_ **NOT** ~~Who did write this?~~

## indirect questions

> Could you tell ne **what time the shop next door opens**?
>
> Do you know **if (whether) Mark's coming to the meeting**?

- We use indirect questions when we want to ask a question in a more polite way.
  We begin with a phrase such as _Can / Could you tell me...? Do you know...? Do you think...? Do you remember...? Would you mind telling me...? Do you have any ides...?_

- Compare:

  What time does the post office open? (direct question) and _Could you tell me what time the post office opens?_ (indirect question)

- In indirect questions, the order is subject + verb. _Can you tell me where **it is**?_ **NOT** ~~Can you tell me where **is it**?~~

- We don't use _do / did_ in the second part of the question. _Do you know where he lives?_ **NOT** ~~...where does he live?~~

- You can use _if_ or _whether_ in questions without a question word and after:
  _Can you tell me, Do you know, etc._

> **Other expressions followed by the word order of indirect questions**
>
> _The word order of indirect questions is used after:_
>
> _I wonder ..., e.g. **I wonder** why they didn't come._
>
> _I'm not sure..., e.g. **I'm not** sure what time is starts._
>
> _I can't remember..., e.g. **I can't remember** where I left my phone._
>
> _I'd like to know..., e.g. **I'd like to know** what time you're coming home._

- If we want to say who did an action in a passive structure, we use by. _The Sagrada Familia was designed by Antoni Gaudi._

## Active or passive?

We can often say things in two ways, in the active or the passive.

1. Using active or passive changes the focus.

   Compare:

   The royal family **owns** Windsor Castle.

   (**Active:** The focus is more on the owner.)

   Windsor Castle **is owned** by the royal family.

   (**Passive:** The focus is more on the castle. )

2. The passive is often used for a more formal style.

   Compare:

   They `grow` rice in Valencia.

   (**Active:** informal - they = people, farmers)

   Rice `is grown` in Valencia.

   (**Passive:** a more formal style)
