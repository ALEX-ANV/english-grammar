# Past tenses

[Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0q24_bB_54&ab_channel=LearnEnglishwithRebecca%C2%B7engVid)

# Modals of deduction: might, can’t, must

- Might (when you think something is possible true)

  _Examples:_

  Tony’s phone is switched off. He might be on the plane now, or just boarding.
  Laura might not like that skirt. It’s not really her style.

- Can’t (when you are sure something is impossible / not true )

  _Examples:_

  Nigel can’t earn much money in his job. He’s still living with his parents.
  That woman can’t be Jack’s wife. Jack’s wife has dark hair.

- Must (when you are sure something is true)

  _Examples:_

  The neighbors must be out. There aren’t any lights on in the house.
  Your sister must have a lot of money if she drives a Porsche.

# Past and present habits and states

1. I **used to teach** English when I was living abroad.

   He **didn't use to do** any exercise, but now he runs marathons

   I **never used to like** football, but I watch it every week now.

   We **used to be** close friends, but we don't talk to each other any more.

   That hotel **used to have** a swimming pool, but they closed it.

   **Did** they **use to live** in the city centre?

   **Didn't** you **use to have** long hair?

2. I **usually meet** my friends at weekends.

   I **don't normally go out** during the week.

   English houses **usually have** gardens.

   **Do** you **normally walk** to work?

## Grammar

1. For past habits and states, we use _used to / didn't use to + infinitive_

- used to does not exist in the present tense. **NOT** ~~I use to get up at 8.00 during the week.~~
- We use _used to_ for things that were true over a period of time in the past. _used to_ often refers to something which is not true now.

  _I used to do a lot of sport._ (= I did a lot of sport for a period of time in the past, but now I don't)

- We often use never _used to_ instead of _didn't use_ to.
- _used to / didn't use_ to can be used with action verbs (e.g. go, do) and non-action verbs (e.g. be, have)
- We can also use the past simple to describe past habits (often with an adverb of frequency).

  _We (often) went to France for our holidays when I was a child._

2. For present habits, we use a verb in the present simple, often with an adverb of frequency, e.g. _usually_ or _normally_.

- **used to or past simple ?**

  We can use used to or the past simple (often with an adverb of frequency) for repeated actions or states and the meaning is the same.

  _I used to live in Leeds as a child. I lived in Leeds as a child._

  _We used to go to the cinema on Sundays. We often went to the cinema on Saturdays._

  But we have to use the past simple if:

  - we mention exact dates or number of times.
  - the action happened only once.

    _We went to the cinema on Saturday_

- **any more and any longer**
  We often use not... _any more / any longer (= not now)_ with the present simple to contrast with _used to_.

  _I used to go to the gym, but I don't (go) any more / any longer._

- **be used to and get used to**
  Don't confuse _used to / didn't use to (do sth)_ with be used to or get used to (doing sth).

  **I am used to getting up** early every day. (= I am accustomed to id - I always do it, so it is not a problem for me)

  Lola **can't get used to living** in the UK. (= She can't get accustomed to it, it's a problem for her)

[Watch video](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/preposition-collocations-1.html)

## prepositions of time

[Watch video](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/prepositions-of-time.html)

## prepositions of place

> Prepositions that describe place, like _in_ and _on_, can be used with different verbs and places and the meaning doesn't change.

_Examples:_

- She sat **in** the square and watched the tourists.
- There's a box **under** your bed.
- You'll find some cash **inside** my purse.
- The cups are **on** that shelf there.
- There's a man standing **in front of** the gate.

- He ran **across** the road.
- He walked **through** the door.
- Go **along** the street, **past** the chemist's.
- Don't run **down** the steps. You'll fall.

## dependent prepositions after verbs and adjectives

_Examples:_

   Everybody **laughed at** me.

2. I'm **worried about** my camera - the flash isn't working.

   Lily's **interested in** astrology.

3. Tony's **good at spending** other people's money.

   She **believes in taking** lots of pictures and then choosing the best.

- Some verbs are always followed by the same preposition.
- Some adjectives are always followed by the same preposition.
- If there is a verb after the preposition, we use the _-ing_ form, not the infinitive.

> **The verbs _ask_, _discuss_, _enter_, _marry_, and _tell_ have no prepositions, e.g.**
>
> I **asked Jack** a question. **NOT** ~~asked to~~
>
> We **discussed the situation**. **NOT** ~~discussed about~~
>
> The police officers **entered the building**. **NOT** ~~entered in~~
>
> She **married her personal trainer**. **NOT** ~~married with~~
>
> The photographer **told everyone** to smile. **NOT** t~~old to everyone~~

>
> 2. If the object is a pronoun (_it, them_, etc.), it _always_ goes between the verb and the particle.
>
> _I switched it off_. **NOT** ~~_I switched off it._~~

>
>    _We take after our father. We take after him._
>
>    **NOT** ~~_We take our father after. We take him after_~~
>
> 2. Some phrasal verbs have two particles - they are never separated.

## forms of the passive

| Tense                        | Form                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **present simple**           | The site `is visited` by thousands of people every year.                                          |
| **present continuous**       | The castle `is being restored` at the moment.                                                     |
| **present perfect**          | The King's body `has never been found`.                                                           |
| **past simple**              | 10,000 soldiers `were killed` in an hour at the Battle of Gettysburg.                             |
| **past continuous**          | The bridge was closed because it `was being repaired`.                                            |
| **past perfect**             | The hospital `had been opened` by the Queen three years before.                                   |
| **_will_ and _be going to_** | When `will` the new museum `be built`? <br> We `are going to be given` our exam results tomorrow. |
| **infinitive with to**       | The city centre has `to be closed` to all traffic next weekend.                                   |
| **infinitive without to**    | The President must `be elected` by a clear majority                                               |
| **gerund**                   | Most people hate `being woken up` in the middle of the night.                                     |

- We often use the passive when it's not said, known, or important who does an action. My phone has been stolen. (= Somebody has stolen my phone, but we don't know who.)
- If we want to say who did an action in a passive structure, we use by. _The Sagrada Familia was designed by Antoni Gaudi._
- The subject of a passive sentence can be the direct or the indirect object, e.g.

  **Active**: _They are going to give **us** (indirect object) **our exam results** (direct object) tomorrow._

  **Passive** _We are going to be given our exam results tomorrow. **OR** Our exam results are going to be given to us tomorrow_

- We often use the passive to talk about processes, for example, scientific processes, and in formal writing, such as newspaper reports.

  _The chemicals are combined at very high temperatures. Parts of Windsor Castle have been damaged in a fire._

## Active or passive?

We can often say things in two ways, in the active or the passive.

1. Using active or passive changes the focus.

   Compare:

   The royal family `owns` Windsor Castle.

   (**Active:** The focus is more on the owner.)

   Windsor Castle `is owned` by the royal family.

   (**Passive:** The focus is more on the castle. )

2. The passive is often used for a more formal style.

   Compare:

   They `grow` rice in Valencia.

   (**Active:** informal - they = people, farmers)

   Rice `is grown` in Valencia.

   (**Passive:** a more formal style)

# Dynamic and Static Verbs

Every English sentence must have a `VERB`. The verb could be classified as dynamic, stative, or both. A `DYNAMIC VERB` describes an action; a `STATIVE VERB` describes a condition. This classification is important because it determines how the verb can and cannot be used. Knowing the difference between stative and dynamic verbs will help you speak and write correctly and avoid basic errors in exams or emails, as well as in many social, academic, and business situations.

## VERBS: DYNAMIC, STATIVE, OR BOTH?

---

`DYNAMIC VERBS` describe action. Examples are **_run_**, **_jump_**, **_work_**, **_play_**, **_eat_**, or **_drink_**. They are the most common type of verb and can be used correctly in all verb tenses and aspects. They are usually the easiest to learn.

| Tense              | Example                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| simple             | I run. <br>I ran. <br> I will run.                                       |
| continuous         | I am running. <br>I was running.<br>I will be running.                   |
| perfect            | I have run.<br>I had run.<br>I will have run.                            |
| perfect continuous | I have been running.<br>I had been running.<br>I will have been running. |

`STATIVE VERBS` describe states or conditions. Examples are **_know_**, **_believe_**, or **_understand_**. These verbs can be used in simple and perfect tenses and aspects. However, they cannot be used in the continuous or progressive forms. This limitation makes stative verbs a little more difficult to master, which means practice is necessary.

### STATIVE VERBS – CORRECT USAGE

| Tense   | Example                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| simple  | I know.<br>I knew.<br>I will know.                  |
| perfect | I have known.<br>I had known.<br>I will have known. |

### STATIVE VERBS – INCORRECT USAGE

| Tense              | Example                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| continuous         | I am knowing.<br>I was knowing.<br>I will be knowing.                    |
| perfect continuous | I have been knowing.<br>I had been knowing.<br>I will have been knowing. |

`DYNAMIC/STATIVE VERBS` can be used in either way, depending on the context or meaning. Examples are **_have_**, **_think_**, and **_feel_**. These verbs are usually the most challenging because there’s no one rule; you have to think about each situation separately. Practice is essential. However, by paying careful attention, you can learn to use these unusual verbs correctly and confidently.

### DYNAMIC/STATIVE VERBS – CORRECT USAGE

|            Tense            | Example                                                                                 |
| :-------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| simple: <br>for possession  | I have a car.<br>I had a car.<br>I will have a car.                                     |
| continuous:<br>for activity | I am having a good time.<br>I was having a good time. <br>I will be having a good time. |

### DYNAMIC/STATIVE VERBS – INCORRECT USAGE

|             Tense             | Example                                                              |
| :---------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| continuous:<br>for possession | I am having a car.<br>I was having a car.<br>I will be having a car. |

Although stative verbs may seem complicated, you have now taken the first step to mastering them: you know that they exist! Soon, you will start noticing them while reading books, websites, and articles, as well as while listening to songs, shows, and presentations. Before long, you will begin using stative verbs correctly yourself.
